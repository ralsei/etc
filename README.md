My personal dotfiles.
This branch is dedicated to my experiments with NixOS. It will likely be merged
into master momentarily, as my new system runs NixOS.

To install it:
- Copy things *selectively* in `system/` to `/etc/nixos` -- much of this is 
  only relevant if you are on my machine
- ln -s "$(pwd)" ~/.config/nixpkgs
- `home-manager switch`

...but why would you install my dotfiles? They're mine, not yours. Go away.
