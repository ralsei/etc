My personal dotfiles for NixOS.

To install it:
- Don't.
- `git clone https://git.qtp2t.club/hazel/etc /etc/nixos`
- `ln -s machines/<machine> machines/current`
- `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`
- Wonder why you installed dotfiles that aren't yours
- Watch as your hardware breaks because you messed up the drivers by installing
  dotfiles that aren't yours
- Become full of regret
